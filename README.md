# 8-bit-Number-Conversion

## Description
This is a web version of a small [python program](https://github.com/Julian-Fletcher/NumberSystems2) I wrote to practice converting numbers between bases. I decided to make a web-version of it and expand it to 8-bit numbers. The page allows you to convert between 8 bit numbers in base 10, 16, and 2. 

### Modes
The specific modes are:
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Decimal to Hexadecimal
3. Binary to Decimal
4. Binary to Hexadecimal
5. Hexadecimal to Decimal
6. Hexadecimal to Binary

I will also host this on my portfolio website [here](https://julian-fletcher.github.io/) so it can easily be accessed.
